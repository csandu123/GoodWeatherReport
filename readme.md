# Weather Dashboard

Welcome to my weather dashboard! This project was made to showcase some JS skills and provide a useful application in the process!

It is a very basic build, using only js, css and html. API data obtained from OpenWeather.

Simply search any city and instantly see all the weather information you need to know!
